# Contribution Guidelines

This document outlines what you need to know before creating [bug reports](#bug-reports),
[feature requests](#feature-requests) or [pull requests](#pull-requests).

## Bug reports

[Use the search first](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-MQTT/issues?q=is%3Aissue). Nothing found that sounds
like your bug? Then please use the [provided ticket template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-MQTT/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
(which also gets prefilled) and make sure to *provide all requested information*.

Be advised though that I have my hands full with maintaining [core OctoPrint](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint)
already, so fixing bugs here heavily depends on others sending pull requests.

## Feature requests

[Use the search first](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-MQTT/issues?q=is%3Aissue). Nothing found that sounds
like your feature request? Then feel free to create it.

Be advised though that I have my hands full with maintaining [core OctoPrint](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint)
already, so implementing features here heavily depends on others sending pull requests.

## Pull requests

Please create all pull requests against the ``devel`` branch. Do not change the version number, that will be done as
part of the next release. Make sure to also adjust the `README.md` as necessary.
